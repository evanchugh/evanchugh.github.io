              I am a Computer Science major and Student Researcher at Canisius College in <span class="text-nowrap">Buffalo, New York.</span> I have a strong interest in reinforcement learning, and plan to pursue a PhD on this topic in the next several years. My research history has included gait analysis and classification of patients with Parkinson's Disease. I am currently researching methods of segmentation for cardiovascular anatomy through the use of convolutional neural networks.

    <p class="font-weight-light">
      Independently established a relationship between Canisius College and a local medical practice.
      Gained experience with IRB and HIPAA guidelines. Created a utility to automate removal of PHI.
      Worked with healthcare providers to label key dimensions frequently referenced during
      diagnosis. Constructed a convolutional neural network for heart chamber segmentation,
      achieving 98% pixel-wise accuracy over a validation set by leveraging data augmentation with a
      training set of approximately 180 images. Publication in progress.

    <p class="mb-2 font-italic">Evan Chugh, Debra Burhans, Jon Mrowczynski</p>
    <p class="font-weight-light">
      Investigated the use of recurrent neural networks in creating real-time responses to human
      motion. Used gait and pressure data for classification of patients with Parkinson’s Disease.
      Implemented a data collection system into the existing application pipeline. A study based on
      this work has shown moderate success in correcting the gait of patients with Parkinson’s Disease.
