               I am a Computer Science major and Undergraduate Machine Learning Researcher at Canisius College in Buffalo, New York. I have a strong interest in medical applications of computer vision, and plan to pursue a PhD on this topic in the next several years.
               My research history has included gait analysis and classification of patients with Parkinson's Disease. I am currently studying detection and classification of cardiovascular disease through the use of deep learning.

            <p>
               Although Canisius is not regarded as a top school for Computer Science or Data Science, I have done my best to further my own knowledge. This has not only occurred through independent study and mentorship from faculty member Dr. Debra Burhans, but also through summer research opportunities.
               If you would like to collaborate on any research, projects, or competitions, do not hesitate to send me an email.

               Independently established a relationship between Canisius College and a local medical practice. Gained experience with IRB and HIPAA guidelines. Created a utility to scrub studies of PHI. Worked with doctors to <u>label high risk indicators of heart disease</u>, then constructed and <u>trained a convolutional neural network to be used in future patient screenings</u>.

              Investigated the use of <u>recurrent neural networks in creating real-time responses to human motion</u>. <u>Used gait and pressure data for detection of patients with early onset Parkinson’s Disease</u>. Implemented a data collection system into the existing application pipeline. A study based on this work has shown moderate success in correcting the gait of patients with Parkinson’s Disease.
