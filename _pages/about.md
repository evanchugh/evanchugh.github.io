Evan is a lifelong resident of Western New York and a member of the Class of 2021 at Canisius College, located just inside the city of Buffalo, NY. While he immensely enjoys anything having to do with technology, he also has a passion for classical guitar, which has spanned over a decade. He plans to pursue a PhD in machine learning after completing his undergraduate study in Computer Science & Mathematics. This website will be a showcase of the projects he has most enjoyed working on, while at the same time hopefully allowing others to learn from the work he has completed.

His CV can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/CV.pdf).
