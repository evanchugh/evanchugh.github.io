I'm currently a sophomore at Canisius College, located just inside the city of Buffalo, NY. While I immensely enjoy anything having to do with technology, I also have a passion for classical guitar which has spanned over a decade. This website will be a showcase of the projects I have most enjoyed working on, while at the same time hopefully allowing others to learn from the work I have completed.
